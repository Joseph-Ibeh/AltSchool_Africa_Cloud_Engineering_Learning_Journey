🚀 AltSchool Africa - First Semester Project 🚀
I'm thrilled to present my First-Semester Project at AltSchool Africa, School of Engineering. This project showcases my learning progress in HTML, CSS, and version control through Git. Below are the key sections of the project, along with the live demo link and a special image I’ve included from my GitHub.

📝 Project Breakdown
1. Personal Bio Page
This page introduces me, highlights my motivations for joining AltSchool, and outlines my personal and professional goals.
It includes a scroll-to-top button for easy navigation, ensuring a smooth user experience.
2. AltSchool Application Form
A structured form built using semantic HTML tags that simulates an AltSchool application process.
It contains various interactive elements like text inputs, dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons, all properly organized for usability and accessibility.
Features a navigation bar for quick access to different sections of the form.
3. Courses and Schools Table
A comprehensive table that lists all the courses and schools offered at AltSchool Africa.
Structured using semantic table tags, ensuring clarity and proper hierarchy for users and screen readers alike.

A responsive page designed to showcase personal information using different media elements, such as images, videos, and audio files.
Implemented the <picture> element with multiple image sources to ensure responsiveness across devices (mobile, tablet, and laptop).
Applied CSS media queries to adjust the layout and media elements based on screen size, providing a seamless experience across all devices.
🚀 Technologies & Tools
