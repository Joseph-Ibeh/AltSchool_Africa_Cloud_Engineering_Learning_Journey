# ðŸš€ Learning Journey Update at AltSchool Africa: Kubernetes ðŸš€

So far, Iâ€™ve learned about **Kubernetes** â€“ the powerful open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

As part of my cloud engineering journey, Kubernetes is an essential tool to master for managing complex applications in the cloud and ensuring efficient, scalable, and reliable deployment.

## Here are a few things Iâ€™ve learned so far:

- **Kubernetes Basics**: How containers work and why Kubernetes is the go-to solution for orchestrating them.
- **Core Components**: Understanding Pods, Nodes, Deployments, Services, and more.
- **Hands-on Experience**: Creating Kubernetes clusters, scaling applications, and managing deployments.
- **Real-World Use Cases**: How major tech companies use Kubernetes to ensure seamless and resilient infrastructure.
