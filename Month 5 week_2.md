# ðŸš€ Diving Deeper into Cloud Engineering: Weekly Learning Recap ðŸš€

Last week, I delved into some essential topics in cloud engineering at AltSchool Africa, and I wanted to share my progress with you all! Hereâ€™s an overview of what Iâ€™ve been working on:

## Systemd Mastery
I explored systemd, which is used to manage services on Linux systems. I learned how to:
- Start, stop, and enable services (e.g., `systemctl start apache2.service`)
- Monitor services effectively with `journalctl` 

Understanding systemd has shown me how essential service management is to ensure smooth and reliable operations across systems.

## Configuring Apache Service
I gained hands-on experience configuring Apache, a widely-used web server:
- Installed and secured Apache to prevent unauthorized access
- Customized configurations to optimize server performance

Itâ€™s amazing to see how even small configuration changes can significantly impact a serverâ€™s efficiency.

## CIS Security Benchmarks
Security is a top priority in cloud engineering. I studied CIS Security Benchmarks, which offer guidelines to secure Linux environments:
- Hardened systems against common vulnerabilities
- Ensured compliance with industry security standards

Learning these benchmarks has helped me build a more secure cloud infrastructure.

## Linux Firewall Fundamentals
Firewalls are our first line of defense! I studied Linux firewalls and learned best practices for network security:
- Implemented rules to allow or block specific traffic
- Protected critical systems by controlling network access points

Understanding firewall principles empowers me to better secure systems against unauthorized access.

## Practicing Linux Firewall Commands
I practiced essential firewall commands:
- Used commands like `ufw allow` and `iptables` to manage and configure firewall rules
- Reinforced my ability to secure network traffic and mitigate potential threats

Every command I learn brings me one step closer to becoming a more proficient cloud engineer.


Each topic has been a step toward becoming a well-rounded cloud engineer, and Iâ€™m excited to keep building my expertise in these areas.
