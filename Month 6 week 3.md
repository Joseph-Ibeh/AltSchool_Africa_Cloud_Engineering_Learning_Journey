# üóìÔ∏è **Weekly Learning Update | Altschool Africa - Cloud Engineering Program ‚òÅÔ∏è**

Last week, I explored another key concept in **cloud engineering**, focusing on foundational aspects that are pivotal in understanding how modern cloud infrastructures operate. Below are the main areas I delved into:



## üîπ **Cloud Computing Fundamentals**  
Cloud computing refers to the delivery of computing services‚Äîservers, storage, databases, networking, software, and more‚Äîover the internet, often referred to as **"the cloud."** These services are designed to reduce the burden on traditional physical hardware and enable scalable, flexible access to resources on-demand.

Key principles of cloud computing include:  
- **On-Demand Self-Service:** Users can provision computing resources as needed without requiring human intervention.  
- **Broad Network Access:** Services are accessible from any device connected to the internet.  
- **Resource Pooling:** Providers share physical and virtual resources dynamically across users.  
- **Rapid Elasticity:** Resources can be scaled up or down quickly to meet varying demand.  
- **Measured Service:** Users pay for only the resources they consume.


## üîπ **Cloud Services**  
Cloud services represent the different categories of computing services provided by cloud providers. These are designed to meet varying user needs across industries and use cases.

### Common Types of Cloud Services:  

- **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):**  
  Virtualized computing resources such as virtual machines, storage, and networks.  
  **Examples:** Amazon EC2, Azure Virtual Machines  

- **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**  
  A platform that allows developers to build, deploy, and manage applications without worrying about infrastructure.  
  **Examples:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine  

- **Software as a Service (SaaS):**  
  Software applications delivered over the internet on a subscription basis.  
  **Examples:** Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Dropbox  

- **Desktop as a Service (DaaS):**  
  Virtual desktops hosted in the cloud and accessible securely from any device.  
  **Examples:** Amazon WorkSpaces, Microsoft Windows 365  

- **Function as a Service (FaaS):**  
  A serverless computing model that allows developers to execute code in response to events without server management.  
  **Examples:** AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions  

- **Storage as a Service (StaaS):**  
  Cloud-based storage solutions enabling on-demand storage without physical hardware.  
  **Examples:** Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage  

Understanding these categories is essential as they lay the foundation for designing, scaling, and deploying real-world cloud applications.


## üîπ **Cloud Providers**  
Cloud providers are the companies that offer cloud computing services. They provide the infrastructure, platforms, and tools necessary for businesses and individuals to build and scale cloud solutions.

The most prominent cloud providers include:  

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** A market leader with a comprehensive range of services.  
- **Microsoft Azure:** Integrated with Microsoft tools, offering a range of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, DaaS, and FaaS options.  
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP):** Known for its data analytics and machine learning tools.  

Getting familiar with these providers allows one to understand how companies adopt cloud solutions and manage resources.



## üîπ **Cloud Deployment Models**  
Cloud deployment models define how cloud services are deployed and how they are made available to users. They vary based on access, ownership, and infrastructure sharing.

The primary deployment models include:

- **Public Cloud:** Services are delivered over the public internet and shared across multiple organizations (e.g., AWS, Azure, or GCP).  
- **Private Cloud:** Services are maintained on a private network, offering exclusive access to a single organization.  
- **Hybrid Cloud:** A combination of both public and private clouds, allowing data to move between the two.  
- **Community Cloud:** Shared infrastructure for multiple organizations with shared interests or requirements, such as compliance or security needs.

Understanding deployment models provides insights into how organizations choose the best strategy for optimizing costs, security, and scalability.


## üí° **Reflection**

This journey through foundational concepts has been insightful, and I'm eager to continue building my understanding and practical skills in cloud engineering. Exploring cloud services, deployment models, and cloud providers has provided clarity on how interconnected systems are scaled and maintained in today's technological landscape.
