# Weekly Learning Journey: Exploring AWS Hands-On  
Last week, I immersed myself in hands-on AWS learning and gained practical experience with core AWS services. Here's a summary of the concepts I explored:  

## 1. AWS Regions and Availability Zones  
- **Regions:** Geographically isolated areas where AWS provides services (e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`).  
- **Availability Zones (AZs):** Multiple, isolated data centers within a region for fault tolerance and high availability.  
- **Key Insight:** Understanding regions and AZs is essential for deploying resilient applications.  

## 2. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)  
- Learned to create and manage EC2 instances for scalable compute capacity.  
- Explored instance types, Amazon Machine Images (AMI), and configurations.  
- **Practical Skill:** Launched and connected to an EC2 instance for hosting applications.  

## 3. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)  
- Discovered how to use S3 for storing and retrieving data securely.  
- Worked with buckets and objects, and explored storage classes for cost optimization.  
- **Hands-On:** Created and managed S3 buckets for data storage.  

## 4. Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)  
- Built a virtual private cloud with subnets, route tables, and security groups.  
- **Focus:** Configured a secure and isolated network environment for my AWS resources.  

## 5. Creating an Instance  
- Practiced the steps for launching a virtual server:  
  1. Selected an AMI (e.g., Amazon Linux 2).  
  2. Configured VPC, subnets, and instance types (e.g., `t2.micro`).  
  3. Set up security groups and connected via SSH.  
- **Outcome:** Successfully launched and accessed an instance for hands-on experimentation.  

## 6. Elastic IP Address  
- Assigned a static IP to my EC2 instance to maintain consistent accessibility.  
- **Learning Point:** Elastic IPs are useful for applications requiring fixed IP addresses.  

## 7. Load Balancer  
- Explored how load balancers distribute traffic across multiple resources.  
- Learned about different types of load balancers:  
  - **Application Load Balancer (ALB):** For HTTP/HTTPS traffic.  
  - **Network Load Balancer (NLB):** For low-latency traffic.  
  - **Classic Load Balancer (CLB):** Basic load balancing for legacy applications.  
- **Practical Use:** Understood how to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.  

### Key Takeaway  
Last week has been a transformative journey in deepening my knowledge of AWS services and building confidence in deploying cloud infrastructure. Iâ€™m excited to continue exploring and mastering cloud engineering!
