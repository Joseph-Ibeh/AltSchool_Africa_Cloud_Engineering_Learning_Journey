# Last Week at AltSchool Africa School of Engineering

## Submission of Second Semester Project Examination

### Question:

“Imagine you are part of a startup team tasked with creating a prototype for a web application. Your first step is to provision a server and set up a simple landing page to demonstrate your team’s capabilities to potential investors. Your task is as follows:”

### 1. Provisioning the Server:
- Use any virtualization or cloud platform (AWS) to set up a Linux server.
- Install a Linux distribution of your choice (e.g., Ubuntu).

### 2. Web Server Setup:
- Install a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) to serve web content.

### 3. HTML Page Deployment:
Create a simple HTML page with the following information:
- Your name.
- A project title: “Welcome to [Your Name] Landing Page.”
- A brief description of your project.
- Your full bio with every interesting piece of information about you.
- Deploy the HTML page on the server.

### 4. Networking:
- Configure the server to allow HTTP traffic (port 80).
- Provide the public IP address (or URL if using DNS) so your page can be accessed from any browser.

### 5. Deliverables:
- The public IP address or URL of your web page.
- A screenshot showing your HTML page in a browser.
- Write clear, step-by-step documentation of how you provisioned the server, installed the web server, deployed the HTML page, and configured networking.



## Bonus Tasks (Optional for Extra Credit):
- Configure HTTPS for your web server using a free SSL certificate (e.g., Let’s Encrypt).



## Submission Instructions:
- Create your submissions and screenshots in a Git repository.
- The documentation required should be in the `Readme.md` of your GitHub repository.
- The documentation should contain your public IP address and any other useful information to run your web server.
