# ðŸš€ Continuous Learning in DevOps & Cloud Engineering!  

Lately, we dove deeper into Continuous Integration (CI) platforms, managing change effectively, and expanding my knowledge of Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). My learning journey has covered:  

- âœ… Understanding CI/CD platforms and automating workflows  
- âœ… Managing change efficiently in cloud environments  
- âœ… Terraform basics: Code structure, plan, apply, update, & destroy  
- âœ… Working with variables to improve infrastructure flexibility  

As I keep building and experimenting, Iâ€™m excited about mastering more DevOps best practices and cloud automation strategies. ðŸš€
