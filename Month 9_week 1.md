# ðŸš€ Last Week's Learning at AltSchool Africa  

## ðŸ”¹ CI/CD with GitHub Actions  

Last week, I explored **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)** using **GitHub Actions**. I learned how to:  
âœ… Automate builds, tests, and deployments.  
âœ… Define workflows using YAML.  
âœ… Use key components like workflows, jobs, steps, and actions.  
âœ… Trigger workflows with events like `push` and `pull_request`.  

### ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways  
- CI/CD improves efficiency, code quality, and collaboration.  
- GitHub Actions enables seamless automation within repositories.  
- Implementing a basic workflow to install dependencies and run tests.
