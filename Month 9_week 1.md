# Weekly Learning Update: Introduction to Jenkins

Last week at AltSchool Africa, I was introduced to Jenkins, an open-source automation tool for Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). I learned about its installation, basic configuration, and how to create a simple pipeline using Jenkinsfile.

### Key Takeaways:
- Jenkins automates software development workflows.
- Supports multiple plugins for extended functionality.
- Pipelines streamline the build, test, and deployment process.
