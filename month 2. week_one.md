# Week 5: Continued Learning in HTML at Altschool Africa üåü

This week, we built upon our HTML foundation, diving deeper into HTML tags, attributes, and elements. The journey was insightful, and I‚Äôm thrilled to share what I‚Äôve learned with you!

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. The `<body>` Tag
   The `<body>` tag is a vital part of any HTML document as it defines the main content area that users interact with. It contains all the visible elements on a webpage such as:
   - Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
   - Paragraphs (`<p>`)
   - Images (`<img>`)
   - Links (`<a>`)
   - Tables (`<table>`)
   - Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`)
   - Forms (`<form>`)

   The `<body>` tag is where we bring together all our content to create a user-friendly web experience. Without it, the webpage would be incomplete!

### 2. Common HTML Attributes
   Attributes in HTML allow us to add extra functionality and meaning to elements. Here are some important ones we focused on this week:
   
   - `href`: Used in anchor tags (`<a>`) to specify the URL of the link.
     ```html
     <a href="https://example.com">Visit Example</a>
     ```
   - `src`: Specifies the source URL for images (`<img>`) and other media like audio or video files.
     ```html
     <img src="image.png" alt="Example Image">
     ```
   - `title`: Provides additional information about an element when hovered over, like a tooltip.
     ```html
     <p title="Hello!">Hover over this text to see a tooltip.</p>
     ```
   - `alt`: Describes an image for accessibility purposes, especially important for screen readers or if the image fails to load.
     ```html
     <img src="image.png" alt="Description of the image">
     ```
   - `required`: Used in form input fields to ensure that users must fill out the field before submitting.
     ```html
     <input type="text" name="name" required>
     ```

### 3. Common HTML Elements
   This week, we explored several key elements that enhance the structure and functionality of webpages:

   - Tables (`<table>`): Organizes data into rows and columns for easy viewing and analysis.
     ```html
     <table>
       <tr>
         <th>Name</th>
         <th>Age</th>
       </tr>
       <tr>
         <td>John</td>
         <td>30</td>
       </tr>
     </table>
     ```
   - Lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`): Used to display ordered or unordered lists of items.
     ```html
     <!-- Unordered List -->
     <ul>
       <li>Item 1</li>
       <li>Item 2</li>
     </ul>

     <!-- Ordered List -->
     <ol>
       <li>First Item</li>
       <li>Second Item</li>
     </ol>
     ```
   - Forms (`<form>`): A crucial part of user interaction, allowing for the collection of data (such as login information or search queries).
     ```html
     <form action="/submit" method="POST">
       <label for="name">Name:</label>
       <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
       <input type="submit" value="Submit">
     </form>
     ```

By learning about these elements, we are now able to create more structured, meaningful, and interactive web content.

## Session on Defining Your 'WHY'
In addition to the technical content, we had an insightful session on ‚ÄúDefining your ‚ÄòWHY‚Äô and setting achievable goals to navigate your Tech Career.‚Äù This session taught me the importance of identifying my core motivation in tech, which will guide my path and keep me focused.

Understanding my "why" is crucial as it aligns my actions with my long-term goals, helping me stay motivated and purposeful as I continue on this journey. It‚Äôs a valuable mindset that will not only shape my career but also help me overcome challenges along the way.

## Looking Ahead
I‚Äôm excited about the progress I‚Äôm making and can‚Äôt wait to continue building more complex projects using HTML. Stay tuned for more updates! üíª‚ú®
