# 🌟 Last week at AltSchool Africa Cloud Engineering Program, I had an exciting introduction to the Linux operating system! 🌟

## 🔹 What I Learned:

- Operating System Basics 💻: 
  - Definition and Types of Operating Systems: An operating system (OS) is software that acts as an intermediary between computer hardware and users. It manages hardware resources and provides common services for computer programs. Types include **Windows, macOS, Linux,** and **Unix**.

- Components of an OS 🛠️: 
  - These include managing running applications as processes, accessing storage (disk management), memory (RAM management), input/output devices (like keyboards and printers), and network connections (for internet access).

- Evolution of Unix 🔄: 
  - Understanding how Unix, a powerful multi-user OS developed in the 1970s, laid the groundwork for many modern operating systems. Its architecture inspired a multitude of variants and distributions.

- Linux Evolution 🔍: 
  - Tracing the history of Linux from its inception by Linus Torvalds in 1991 to its current robust and flexible form, highlighting its open-source nature and community-driven development.

- Linux Distributions 🐧: 
  - Learning about various Linux distributions, such as Debian, Ubuntu, and Fedora, each catering to different user needs, preferences, and system requirements.

- Linux Setup 🛠️: 
  - Gained insights into the process of installing Linux OS on various hosts, including laptops, desktops, servers, and embedded devices, which is essential for adapting Linux to different environments.

## 🔹 Virtualization & Containers 🚀:
- Explored concepts of virtual machines (using software like VirtualBox) and containers, which allow for efficient resource utilization and isolation of applications.
- Successfully set up Ubuntu LTS on my local machine using Vagrant! 🖥️ This experience was invaluable for understanding how to manage development environments efficiently.

## 🔹 Linux Shell & Commands ⌨️:
- Familiarized myself with different types of Linux shells (like Bash) and key commands, including:
  - PWD: Print Working Directory - displays the current directory.
  - File operations 📂: Commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` for copying, moving, and deleting files.
  - Text editors 📝: Getting accustomed to using editors like nano and vim for editing files directly in the terminal.
  - Seeking help 💬: Utilizing commands like `man` (manual) and `--help` to find documentation on commands.

## 🔹 Managing Users & Groups 👥:
- Learned how to manage users and groups efficiently, which includes adding, modifying, and removing users, as well as setting permissions and group policies for better security and collaboration.

Excited to keep exploring and advancing in this journey! 🚀
