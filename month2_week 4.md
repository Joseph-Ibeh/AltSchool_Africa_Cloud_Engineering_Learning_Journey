# ðŸŒŸ Weekly Learning Update - Month 2, Week 4

Last week, I delved deeper into the fundamentals of HTML elements and attributes, which are crucial for web development. Here's what I learned:

## Key Topics Covered

### HTML Image Syntax
- Embedding Images: We explored how to embed images in a webpage using the `<img>` tag. The syntax requires the `src` attribute to specify the image source and the `alt` attribute for alternative text to enhance accessibility.

### Absolute vs. Relative URLs
- Linking Effectively: Understanding the difference between absolute and relative URLs is essential for navigation within websites. 
  - Absolute URL: A complete web address, e.g., `<a href="https://www.josephibeh.com">Example</a>`.
  - Relative URL: A partial link relative to the current page, e.g., `<a href="page.html">Page</a>`. Choosing the right type ensures proper navigation and resource linking.

### `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` Elements
- Structuring Media Content: The `<figure>` tag is used to encapsulate media content, such as images or diagrams, along with its caption. The `<figcaption>` tag provides a description, enhancing the context and meaning of the visual content. 
  example(html)

  <figure>
      <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
      <figcaption>This is a caption for the image.</figcaption>
  </figure>

The alt Attribute
Enhancing Accessibility and SEO: The alt attribute is vital for providing text alternatives for images, making content accessible for screen readers and improving search engine optimization (SEO).
html

<img src="image.jpg" alt="A brief description of the image">
Images as Links
Improving User Interaction: By using images as clickable links, we can enhance user engagement. This is done by wrapping an <img> tag within an anchor <a> tag.
html

<a href="page.html">
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
</a>
HTML <audio> and <video> Tags
Integrating Multimedia: We learned how to use the <audio> and <video> tags to incorporate audio and video files into web pages. These tags offer built-in controls for users to play, pause, and navigate through the media.
html

<audio src="audiofile.mp3" controls></audio>
<video src="videofile.mp4" controls></video>
Conclusion
These topics provided a solid foundation in HTML elements and their usage, essential for creating engaging and accessible web content. I am excited to apply these new skills in my projects! ðŸš€ðŸ’»
