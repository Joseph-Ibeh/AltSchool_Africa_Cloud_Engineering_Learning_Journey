# üöÄ Deepening My Git and CSS Knowledge at Altschool Africa School of Engineering! üéì

I'm excited to share that I've recently deepened my understanding of Git and have also started diving into CSS, thanks to my ongoing learning journey at Altschool Africa! üåü

## Git üõ†Ô∏è
I explored several important Git commands that are fundamental for version control and collaborative coding:

- `git init`: Initialize a new Git repository.
- `git status`: Check the status of your working directory and staging area.
- `git add`: Stage changes for the next commit.
- `git commit`: Save changes to the repository.
- `git config`: Configure Git settings.
- `git log`: View the commit history.
- `git branch`: Work with branches in your repository.
- `git merge`: Combine changes from different branches.
- `git clone`: Clone an existing repository.
- `git remote add`**: Add a remote repository.
- `git push`: Push changes to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetch and merge changes from a remote repository.
- `git fetch`: Download objects and refs from another repository.
- `git reset`: Undo changes in your working directory.
- `git rebase`: Reapply commits on top of another base tip.
- `git revert`: Create a new commit that undoes changes from a previous commit.
- `git stash`: Temporarily store changes in a dirty working directory.
- `git tag`: Mark a specific point in the repository‚Äôs history.

I also learned how to create a repository and push it to GitHub using the terminal, Visual Studio Code, and a web browser. üíª


## üöÄ CSS üé®
I started my journey into CSS, a vital tool for styling web pages, and covered the following concepts:

### Definition of CSS
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. It controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall visual appearance of a web page.

### Anatomy of CSS
Understanding the structure of a CSS rule, which includes selectors, properties, and values. Here‚Äôs an example of a basic CSS rule:

css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 24px;
}
In this example, h1 is the selector, color and font-size are properties, and blue and 24px are the values.

CSS Selectors and Types
Different ways to select HTML elements to apply styles, such as:

Class selector: Targets elements with a specific class.
css
.button {
  background-color: green;
}
ID selector: Targets a specific element with an ID.
css

#main-heading {
  font-size: 32px;
}
Element selector: Targets HTML tags directly.
css

p {
  line-height: 1.6;
}

-Adding CSS to HTML
CSS can be added to HTML in different ways:

Inline styles: Applying CSS directly within an HTML tag.
html
<h1 style="color: red;">Hello World</h1>

Internal styles: Embedding CSS within the <style> tag in the HTML file.
html

<style>
  p {
    color: purple;
  }
</style>

External styles: Linking to an external CSS file that contains all styles.
html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">

CSS Variables (Custom Properties)
CSS variables are reusable values for properties like colors and fonts. For example:

css

:root {
  --primary-color: #3498db;
}

button {
  background-color: var(--primary-color);
}

-CSS Box Model
Understanding the box model, which includes margins, borders, padding, and content. Here‚Äôs an example demonstrating how the box model affects layout:

css
div {
  margin: 10px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 2px solid black;
}

CSS Layout (Grid)
Using CSS Grid to create complex, responsive grid-based layouts. Here‚Äôs a simple example of a grid layout:

css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 10px;
}

CSS Layout (Flexbox)
Utilizing Flexbox to align and distribute space among items in a container. Here's an example:

css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

CSS Media Queries
Making web pages responsive by applying different styles based on device characteristics like screen width. Here's an example of a media query:

css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
CSS Animation and Types
Creating animations and understanding different types like transitions and keyframes. Here's an example of a simple animation:

css

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

.element {
  animation: fadeIn 2s ease-in;
}
This combination of live instruction and LMS resources has been incredibly valuable, and I'm eager to apply these skills in real-world projects! üíªüöÄ
