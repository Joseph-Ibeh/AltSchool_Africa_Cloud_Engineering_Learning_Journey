Yesterday's onboarding town hall session was a success! We covered various essential concepts, including:

- Curriculum: An overview of the topics and skills we'll be focusing on.
- Content Partners: Information on who we'll be learning from and collaborating with.
- Learning Management System (LMS): How to navigate and utilize the LMS for our studies.
- Live Classes: Expectations and how to make the most of our live learning sessions.
- Assessments: Understanding the evaluation process and criteria.

I truly appreciated the open Q&A session, where industry experts shared valuable insights 💡. One takeaway that resonated with me was the importance of meeting high standards—any exam score below 50% can lead to probation ⚠️. 

I'm committed to documenting my learning and growth on this platform 📝. Let's connect and support each other's professional development if you haven't already! ☁️💻 🤝
