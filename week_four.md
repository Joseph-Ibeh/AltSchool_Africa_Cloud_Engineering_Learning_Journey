# Week 4: Deep Dive into HTML at Altschool Africa üåê

This week has been an immersive and enriching experience in learning the foundational aspects of HTML. The journey was both theoretical and practical, with a focus on understanding and applying various HTML concepts. Here's a detailed look into what I learned:

## Concepts Covered

### 1. Anatomy of an HTML Document
   - I explored the structure of an HTML document, including the essential tags like `<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>`. Understanding the purpose and placement of each element has provided clarity on how web pages are constructed.

### 2. HTML Elements and Tags
   - Self-Closing Tags: I learned about tags that don't require closing, such as `<img />` and `<br />`. This was particularly insightful for creating clean, efficient code.
   - Nesting Elements: I practiced properly nesting elements, ensuring that tags are opened and closed in the correct order to avoid breaking the HTML structure.
   - Empty Elements: I also got familiar with tags that don't have any content between the opening and closing tags, such as `<input>` and `<hr>`.
   
### 3. Hands-On Tools
   - I installed Visual Studio Code (VS Code), an essential tool for writing HTML. Along with it, I installed key extensions:
     - Live Server: To preview my HTML files in real-time as I code.
     - Prettier: For automatically formatting my code, ensuring it's clean and readable.

### 4. Building My First HTML Document
   - Creating my first HTML document was a major milestone. It involved:
     - Structuring content with headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)
     - Adding paragraphs and links using `<p>` and `<a>` tags.
     - Embedding images with the `<img>` tag, and using the `alt` attribute to describe images for accessibility.
     - Handling media by embedding audio and video elements, and even creating download links using the `download` attribute.

### 5. Practical Applications
   - I was able to put theory into practice by constructing well-organized web pages, ensuring that every element was properly structured and styled.
   - Comments (`<!-- -->`) were used to document my code, which is a great way to leave notes and make the code easier to maintain.

## Reflections
Learning HTML has been an empowering experience. Mastering the fundamentals such as document structure, elements, attributes, and handling media has greatly enhanced my web development skills. The practical aspect of building projects and working in VS Code has solidified these concepts.

I‚Äôm excited to keep progressing as I dive deeper into web technologies. Stay tuned for more updates on my journey! üíª‚ú®
