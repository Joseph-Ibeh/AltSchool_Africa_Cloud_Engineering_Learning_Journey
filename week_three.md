# Week 3 Recap: A Game-Changing Week at Altschool Africa üöÄ

Last week at Altschool Africa's School of Engineering was a transformative experience as we delved into the fundamentals of computer science and explored various programming paradigms. 

## Key Topics Covered

### Programming Paradigms
- Procedural Programming: This paradigm is centered around procedures or routines. It emphasizes the sequence of actions to be performed, which makes it easier to follow the flow of the program. Common languages include C and Pascal.
  
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): OOP is based on the concept of "objects," which can contain data and methods. It allows for encapsulation (bundling data and methods), inheritance (creating new classes based on existing ones), and polymorphism (the ability for different classes to be treated as instances of the same class through a common interface). Languages like Java and Python are popular for OOP.

- Functional Programming: This paradigm treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data. It promotes the use of pure functions and is seen in languages like Haskell and Lisp.

### Big O Notation
Big O notation is a mathematical representation used to describe the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space complexity. It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's resource consumption, helping developers evaluate performance as input sizes increase.

### Essential Concepts Learned
- Variables: These are symbolic names associated with values and can change during program execution. Understanding data types (like integers, strings, and booleans) is crucial for effective programming.

- Control Structures: These are constructs that dictate the flow of control in a program. Examples include loops (for, while) and conditional statements (if-else).

- Functions: Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help in breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

- Data Structures: These are ways to organize and store data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues.

- Algorithms: An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem. Understanding algorithms is crucial for writing efficient code.

- Encapsulation, Polymorphism, and Inheritance: These are foundational concepts in OOP that facilitate code organization, reusability, and abstraction.

- Recursion: This is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's often used for tasks that can be defined in terms of smaller sub-problems.

- Error Handling: This involves anticipating and managing errors that may occur during program execution, ensuring the program can handle unexpected inputs gracefully.

- Memory Management and File I/O: These concepts cover how programs use memory (allocating and freeing it) and how to read from and write to files, essential for persistent data storage.

## Web Development Basics
I also got my first taste of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These technologies are foundational for creating interactive and visually appealing websites. HTML structures the content, CSS styles it, and JavaScript adds interactivity, enabling dynamic user experiences. üåê

This week, we're gearing up to take our skills to the next level and get our hands dirty with practical projects! üí™üíª‚ú®
